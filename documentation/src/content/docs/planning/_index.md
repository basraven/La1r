# What's next?
Since I'm (currently) only developing la1r by myself, there are only so many things you can do at once. 
For this reason I created this planning page in which I track and prioritize what I will add to la1r next.
Feel free to add comments on this through Github!

1. Formal service bus definition and separation of raw data and defined event data
1. find-lf - wifi tracking as input events on the Event Bus based on AI models
1. An event data dashboard
1. Ceph file system based on this guide: https://owncloud.org/news/running-owncloud-in-kubernetes-with-rook-ceph-storage-step-by-step/
